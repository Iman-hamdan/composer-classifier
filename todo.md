# Music Composer Classification Web App - Todo List

## Phase 1: Analyze project requirements and research implementation approach
- [x] Research MIDI file processing and feature extraction techniques
- [x] Study deep learning approaches for music classification (LSTM, CNN)
- [x] Investigate existing datasets for classical composer classification
- [x] Research web audio APIs and MIDI playback in browsers
- [x] Analyze the technical architecture needed for the web application

## Phase 2: Gather and prepare training data for the four composers
- [x] Find and download MIDI files for Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Mozart
- [x] Implement data preprocessing pipeline for MIDI files
- [x] Extract musical features (notes, chords, tempo, etc.)
- [x] Create training/validation/test splits
- [x] Prepare data in format suitable for deep learning models

## Phase 3: Implement deep learning model for composer classification
- [x] Implement LSTM model for sequential music data
- [x] Implement CNN model for music pattern recognition
- [x] Train and evaluate both models
- [x] Select best performing model
- [x] Save trained model for deployment

## Phase 4: Create web application frontend with file upload and audio player
- [x] Design user interface similar to the reference application
- [x] Implement file upload functionality for MIDI files
- [x] Create audio player with play/pause/stop controls
- [x] Add prediction results display
- [x] Implement responsive design

#### Phase 5: Develop backend API for model inference and audio processing
- [x] Create Flask backend API
- [x] Implement MIDI file upload endpoint
- [x] Add model inference functionality
- [x] Create health check endpoint
- [x] Enable CORS for frontend integrationle uploads and response## Phase 6: Integrate frontend and backend, test the complete application
- [x] Connect frontend to backend API
- [x] Add proxy configuration for API calls
- [x] Test file upload functionality
- [x] Test sample file loading
- [x] Test prediction accuracy
- [x] Verify error handling
- [x] Test different composers (Bach: 99.8%, Chopin:## Phase 7: Deploy the application and deliver results to user
- [x] Create comprehensive project documentation
- [x] Generate deployment guide with multiple options
- [x] Package complete project files
- [x] Deliver final results to user
- [x] Provide technical summary and performance metrics [ ] Deliver final application to user
